Water Simulation Graphics Project Using OpenGL.

My Main Goals with this project:
To learn foundational and advanced computer graphics skills while learning and using OpenGL. 
The main point of this project is the learning and not so much the result of this project.

Current Acomplishments:
Learned the basic openGL structure, how to set up a context, buffers, shaders and how to draw basic shapes to the screen.
Learned basic GLSL such as creating a vertex shader for the ocean
Learned how waver works in computer graphics, the sum of sines, the derivative to get the tangent and bi for vector normals.

TO DO:
Add specular lighting to the waves
	Need to add camera to even do this
Update the waves to be more ocean-like gyestr waves, or a different wave function
Get IMGui linking to work for the backend side
Get some GUI for the number of waves and other parameters
