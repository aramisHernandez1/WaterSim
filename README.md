# Water Simulation Graphics Project Using OpenGL.

### My Main Goals with this project
To learn foundational and advanced computer graphics skills while learning and using OpenGL. 
The main point of this project is the learning and not so much the result of this project.

### Current Accomplishments
* Basic OpenGL structure
  * How to set up a context and window
  * How to set up shaders and buffers
  * Using GLSL and adding attributes with shaders.
* Learned basic GLSL
  * Creating a vertex shader with multiple data being passed.
  * Using uniforms in both the vertex and fragment shaders.
  * Using techniques to manipulate meshes (sum of sines for ocean).  
* Learned how waver works in computer graphics, the sum of sines, the derivative to get the tangent, and bi for vector normals.

TO DO:
Fix Camera
Enhance lighting system
Create domain warping (believe its called this) so waves push against each other
Try to make the lightning/waves look better (vague)
Refactor program and classes to make neater
Add a sun
Make plane larger
Add fog
Add sky


Get IMGui linking to work for the backend side
Get some GUI for the number of waves and other parameters
