Water Simulation Graphics Project Using OpenGL.

My Main Goals with this project:
To learn foundational and advanced computer graphics skills while learning and using OpenGL. 
The main point of this project being the learning and not so much the result of this project.



TO DO:
Add a simple lightning effect, such as Phong's lighting, to make the waves have more detail.
